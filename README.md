This is a NEMA 0183 aggregator meant to run on a Raspberry Pi. It takes 2-4 Com ports (4800, 9600, and 38400 baud) and outputs the data on a single Com port at 115,200 baud.

No interpretation or modification of the data is done. It is meant for the NEMA 0183 protocol so all lines must end in a <CR><LF>
